Over the course of development, this project has evolved from a simple code-explanation tool into a fully functional web application with authentication, role-based access, and admin controls. Initially, CodeSense only allowed users to paste code and receive explanations through a backend API. Now, it includes a complete Login/Signup system backed by secure JWT authentication and a MongoDB database. Users can create accounts, log in securely, and access the main interface only after verification, ensuring a structured and protected user workflow.

A major addition to the system is the implementation of role-based access. Every user who signs up is assigned a role, either user or admin, enabling the application to differentiate permissions. Admins have access to additional features such as viewing a list of all registered users through a dedicated Admin Panel. These admin-only routes are fully protected using authentication and authorization middleware, ensuring that sensitive data is accessible only to the correct roles.

The frontend has also undergone significant improvements. The interface now includes a clean and interactive Login/Signup page with toggle functionality, and the entire application layout updates dynamically based on the user’s authentication status. The main dashboard, explanation interface, and admin controls are all neatly structured inside controlled containers that appear or hide depending on whether the user is logged in. A fully functioning logout button was added to allow users to securely end sessions.

Overall, the project is now structured, secure, and scalable. The foundations for a full-featured application are in place — including auth, protected APIs, admin operations, UI separation, and persistent user sessions. These updates bring CodeSense closer to a production-ready tool with a dynamic and expandable architecture.
